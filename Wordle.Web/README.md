# Extra Credit 
## 1
The player takes on the role of a hacker attempting to break into a secured system before a countdown expires. The game includes three difficulty levels: Easy (3 words, 12 minutes), Medium (4 words, 15 minutes), and Hard (5 words, 20 minutes). Each correct word guess unlocks system logs, emails, or security messages that reveal clues about a hidden cache of treasure locked behind the system. Poor guesses waste valuable time, while successful guesses bring the player closer to claiming the prize. The ending changes based on how much information the player recovers before time runs out.

## 2 
The game is set in a virtual classroom where players can choose a subject they want to play. Each subject presents word-guessing challenges related to that field. As players correctly guess words, they earn points that can be saved and used to unlock hints or additional clues in future rounds.

## 3 
The player travels through different locations around the world. Before each round begins, a random country is selected through a raffle system. The word-guessing challenge is generated using words related to that country, such as landmarks, culture, food, or history. Correct guesses unlock interesting facts about the selected location.
